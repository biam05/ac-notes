# 4.3 Metalearning and autoML
> .... special slides ..... *yikes*
## Variety of Models
- More specific knowledge, that is, models for smaller subsets, eventually, individual entities

## Model Management
### Bias
- Can't live with it: given a dataset and a learning algorithm, not every model is possible
- Can't live without it: bias-free learning is futile

- **Bias-free algorithm**: can learn any model but doesn't have any preference for one over the other

## Metalearning/automl Role
- Metalearning for algorithm selection
	- induce model from metadata to predict the best algorithm on a new dataset

## Opportunities and Challenges
- Dataset morphing to understand ML algorithm behavior
- dataset characterization
- dataset embeddings
