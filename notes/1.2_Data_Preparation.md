# 1.2 Data Preparation
Where the majority of the time is spent on any data mining project
- importing, manipulating, cleaning, transforming, augmenting

## Data
- Collection of data objects (cases) and their attributes (features)
	- **Attribute**: property/characteristic of an object
	- **Object**: collection of attributes
- Can be **structured** (data table) or **non-structured** (text)
- Can have **non-dependency** or **dependency** (time, space)

### Types of Data Sets
- **Nondependency-oriented data**: no dependencies between cases
- **Dependency-oriented data**: implicit/explicit relationships between cases

### Types of Attributes
#### Categorical/Qualitative Attributes
- **Nominal**: no relationship between values
- **Ordinal**: order between the values, but no mathematical operation can be performed on them

#### Numeric/Quantitative Attributes
- **Discrete**: finite/countably infinite set of values for which differences are meaningful
- **Continuous**: infinite set of values that represent the absolute numbers

### Important Characteristics
- Dimensionality
- Sparsity
- Resolution
- Size

## Data Preparation
Data analysis tasks use source data sets stored in tabular format

### Data Wrangling
Transform and map data from one "raw" data form into another format appropriate for analytics
- **Goal**: attain quality and useful data

#### Steps
1. Discovering
2. Structuring
3. Cleaning
4. Enriching
5. Validating
6. Publishing

## Data Quality
- Raw → values may be missing, inconsistent across different data sources, erroneous → poor data quality

### Data Quality Problems
- Noise and outliers
- Missing values
- Duplicate data
- Inconsistent/incorrect data

#### Noise
- Irrelevant or useless information
- **Possible causes**: incorrect/distorted measurements, proper variability of the domain

#### Outliers
- Data objects with characteristics that are considerably different from most of the other objects in the data sets
- **Cases**: outlier = noise or outliers = goal

#### Missing Values
- **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**: missing value is independent of observed and unobserved data; nothing systematic about it
	- e.g.: a lab value because a lab sample was processes improperly
- **Missing at Random (MAR)**: missing value is related to observed data, not to unobserved data; may be something systematic about it
	- e.g.: missing income value may depend on the age
- **Missing Not a Random (MNAR)**: missing value is related to unobserved data of the variable itself; informative/non-ignorable missingness
	- e.g.: a person did not enter his/weight in a survey

##### Solutions
- **Remove**: critical if there are meany observations with missing values
- **Ignore**
- **Make estimates**: imputation
	- the most common value of the attribute; based on other attributes; more sophisticated methods
	- might introduce bias in data and affect the results

#### Duplicates
- Major issues when merging data from heterogeneous source

#### Inconsistent/Incorrect Data
- The hardest type of data quality issues to detect
- Depends on expert domain knowledge
