# 1.1 Introduction
## Data Mining (DM)
- Non-trivial process of identifying **implicit**, **valid**, **novel** (measured by comparing to expected values), **potentially useful** and **understandable** patterns in date
- Step in the KDD process

## CRISP-DM
Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining

### Objectives
- cheaper, faster and more reliable DM
- widespread adoption
- reduce skills required for data mining
- capture experience for reuse

### Characteristics
- Non-proprietary
- application/industry neutral
- tool neutral
- focus on business issues
- framework for guidance
- experience based

### Phases and Tasks
1. **Business Understanding**
	- Determine Business Objectives, Assess Situation, Determine Data Mining Goals, Produce Project Plan
2. **Data Understanding**
	- Collect Initial Data, Describe Data, Explore Data, Verify Data Quality
3. **Data Preparation**
	- Select Data, Clean Data, Construct Data, Integrate Data, Format Data
4. **Modelling**
	- Select Modeling Technique, Generate Test Design, Build Model, Assess Model
5. **Evaluation**
	- Evaluate Results, Review Process, Determine Next Steps
6. **Deployment**
	- Plan Deployment, Plan Monitoring & Maintenance, Produce Final Report, Review Project

## SCRUM-DM
Scrum work management + CRISP-DM Data Mining
- 3 phases: Business Understanding, Sprint, Deployment
- 6 concepts: PO, SM, Dev. Team, DM Story, PBL, SBL

## Last Remarks
- A DM project should always start with an analysis of the data with traditional query tools
	- 80% can be extracted with SQL
	- 20% (hidden information) requires more advanced techniques
